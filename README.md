Letterpress allows you to write and publish your own book online with a pretty live-preview
WYSIWYG Markdown editor.

Letterpress is a Meteor application that has been built from scratch using ATDD (Acceptance Test 
Driven Development). You can follow a step-by-step guide of how this was done in the book.

#Get the Book
