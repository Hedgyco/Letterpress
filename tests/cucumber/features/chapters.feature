Feature: Chapters

  As an author
  I want to write free and premium content
  So that I can market and sell my work

  Scenario: Unregistered users cannot see premium content
#    Given I am not authenticated
#    When I navigate to "chapter/1"
#    Then I see "This chapter is in preview mode"
#    And I do not see "This is premium content"

  Scenario: Registered users can see premium content
#    Given I navigate to the landing page
#    And I am authenticated
#    When I navigate to "chapter/1"
#    Then I see "This is premium content"
#    And I do not see "This chapter is in preview mode"
